## Design Decisions

### Color Palette
- **Primary Red** (`#E63946`): City Year brand color, used for CTAs and highlights
- **Blue** (`#457B9D`): Professional, trustworthy - used in hero and accents
- **Green** (`#06A77D`): Positive, growth - used for available shifts
- **Yellow** (`#FFD166`): Energetic, attention-grabbing - used for perks banner
- **Neutrals**: Clean grays for text and backgrounds

### Key Improvements
1. **Simplified Navigation**: Clean, sticky navbar with smooth scrolling
2. **Clear Messaging**: Emphasizes professional growth and career pathways
3. **Low Commitment Entry**: Calendar allows trying short shifts before full commitment
4. **Visual Hierarchy**: Better spacing, typography, and visual flow
5. **Mobile-First**: Fully responsive design that works on all devices

## Customization

### Adding Real Video Content
Replace the video placeholders in `VideosSection.jsx` with actual video embeds or links.

### Calendar Data
Update the `shiftsData` object in `CalendarSection.jsx` to connect to your actual scheduling system.

### Donation Integration
Connect the donation buttons in `DonationSection.jsx` to your payment processor (Stripe, PayPal, etc.).

## Technologies Used
